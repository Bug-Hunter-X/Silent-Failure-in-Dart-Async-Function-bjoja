# Silent Failure in Dart Async Function

This example demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: a silent failure within a `try-catch` block inside an `async` function. The `catch` block handles the error by printing it, but doesn't rethrow the exception.  This means the calling function won't know that an error occurred and might continue execution with unexpected results.

The `bug.dart` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to correctly handle the exception to prevent silent failures.

## How to reproduce:
1. Run `bug.dart`.
2. Observe the error message is printed, but the program continues execution without explicitly indicating failure.

## Solution:
The solution involves explicitly rethrowing the exception in the `catch` block, allowing the calling function to handle it appropriately (e.g., by displaying an error message to the user or retrying the operation).
